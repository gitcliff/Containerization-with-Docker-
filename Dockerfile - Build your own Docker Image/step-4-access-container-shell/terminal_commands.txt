# 📦 SUMMARY  
# These commands let you access a running Docker container's shell, navigate its filesystem, view environment variables, and list app files.  
# Language/Platform: Bash (Docker CLI)  
# What you'll learn: How to interactively explore a running container’s environment and files  
# Outcome: Gain hands-on access to the container for debugging, inspecting config, or manual operations  
# Why this matters: Debugging and troubleshooting often require inspecting container internals directly  

# ------------------------------  
# 🧩 SECTION TITLE: Enter Container Shell  
# ------------------------------  
docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/sh  
# ✅ What it does: Opens an interactive shell session inside the running container identified by <container_id>  
# 🧠 Why it matters: Gives direct access to the container’s file system and environment for inspection or debugging  

# ------------------------------  
# 🧩 SECTION TITLE: Navigate and Inspect Environment  
# ------------------------------  
cd /  
# ✅ What it does: Changes directory to the root of the container’s filesystem  
# 🧠 Why it matters: Provides a starting point to explore container files  

env  
# ✅ What it does: Lists all environment variables inside the container, including those set via Dockerfile or docker run  
# 🧠 Why it matters: Helps verify if environment variables like MONGO_DB_USERNAME and MONGO_DB_PWD are set correctly  

ls /home/app/  
# ✅ What it does: Lists files and directories inside the app directory where your code resides  
# 🧠 Why it matters: Confirms your app files were copied into the container and are present for execution  

# ------------------------------  
# ▶️ HOW TO RUN / EXECUTE THIS CODE IN WINDOWS POWERSHELL  
# ------------------------------  
# Commands are the same:  
docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/sh  
cd /  
env  
ls /home/app/  

# ------------------------------  
# ✅ NOTES / GOTCHAS / TIPS  
# ------------------------------  
# - Use `/bin/bash` instead of `/bin/sh` if the container has bash installed  
# - Use `exit` to leave the container shell and return to your host terminal  
# - If you get "exec: /bin/sh: not found", try `/bin/ash` (common in Alpine images)
