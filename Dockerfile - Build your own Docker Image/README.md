#  Dockerfile - Build your own Docker Image

# 📖 Summary

Worked on **10 - Dockerfile - Build your own Docker Image**, focusing on **containerization using Docker and Node.js**.
Tasks included creating a **custom Dockerfile** to define a reproducible environment for a Node.js app and building a Docker image to solve the challenge of environment consistency across development, testing, and production.
Set up **Docker** to automate and optimize application deployment by packaging all dependencies and configurations into an isolated container, aiming to ensure reliable and portable app delivery.

# 🛠️ Tools Used

* **Docker**: 🐳 *Used to create, build, and run containerized applications via Dockerfiles.*
* **Node.js**: ⚙️ *Provided the runtime environment for the app inside the container.*
* **npm**: 🚀 *Handled dependency installation inside the container during the build process.*

---

# 🎯 Skills Gained

* **Dockerfile Writing**: 💡 *Learned how to define environment, dependencies, and startup commands in a Dockerfile for Node.js apps.*
* **Docker Image Creation**: 🔍 *Built and tagged custom Docker images using `docker build` to ensure app consistency.*
* **Container Lifecycle Management**: 🚀 *Practiced running containers, accessing container shells, and inspecting logs for troubleshooting.*

---

# ⚠️ Challenges Faced

* **Ensuring Correct Environment Setup**: 🛠️ *Overcame by correctly setting environment variables and copying app files into the container.*
* **Verifying Application Execution Inside Container**: 🔄 *Solved by accessing the container shell and checking logs to confirm the app runs as expected.*
