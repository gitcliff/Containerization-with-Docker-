# 📦 SUMMARY  
# These commands build a Docker image from your Dockerfile and then list all Docker images on your system.  
# Language/Platform: Bash (Docker CLI)  
# What you'll learn: How to create a Docker image and verify it exists locally  
# Outcome: A Docker image tagged as my-app:1.0 is created and visible in your image list  
# Why this matters: Building images is a fundamental step before running containers from your app  

# ------------------------------  
# 🧩 SECTION TITLE: Build Docker Image  
# ------------------------------  
docker build -t my-app:1.0 .  
# ✅ What it does: Builds a Docker image using the Dockerfile in the current directory (.)  
#   - Tags the image as "my-app" with version "1.0" for easy identification  
# 🧠 Why it matters: Converts your app and its environment into a portable, reproducible container image  

# ------------------------------  
# 🧩 SECTION TITLE: List Docker Images  
# ------------------------------  
docker image ls  
# ✅ What it does: Lists all Docker images on your system with their repository name, tag, image ID, creation date, and size  
# 🧠 Why it matters: Confirms that your image was successfully built and is available for use  

# ------------------------------  
# ▶️ HOW TO RUN / EXECUTE THIS CODE IN WINDOWS POWERSHELL  
# ------------------------------  
# Equivalent commands are the same in PowerShell:  
docker build -t my-app:1.0 .  
docker image ls  

# ------------------------------  
# ✅ NOTES / GOTCHAS / TIPS  
# ------------------------------  
# - If the build fails, check for Dockerfile syntax errors or missing files in the build context  
# - Use descriptive tags (e.g., version numbers) to manage multiple image versions  
# - You can run the image with:  
#   docker run -p 3000:3000 my-app:1.0
