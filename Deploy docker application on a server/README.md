#   Deploy docker application on a server


# 📖 Summary

Worked on **Deploy Docker Application on a Server**, focusing on **using Docker Compose to deploy a multi-container Node.js application with MongoDB**.
Tasks included updating the Docker Compose file to pull the app image from AWS ECR, configuring the Node.js app to connect to a MongoDB container, and orchestrating multiple containers with Docker Compose to solve the challenge of efficiently managing interconnected services.
Set up **Docker Compose and AWS ECR images** to deploy a scalable, portable, and repeatable full-stack application environment on a server.
