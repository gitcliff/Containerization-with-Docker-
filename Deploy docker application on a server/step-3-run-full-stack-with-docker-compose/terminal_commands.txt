# 📦 SUMMARY  
# This command starts all the services defined in your docker-compose.yaml file, creating and running containers as specified.  
# Language/Platform: Bash (Docker Compose)  
# What you'll learn: How to launch multi-container applications using Docker Compose  
# Outcome: Docker containers defined in the docker-compose.yaml will start running on your machine  
# Why this matters: Simplifies running complex applications with multiple containers and dependencies in a single command  

# ------------------------------  
# 🧩 SECTION TITLE: Run Docker Compose File  
# ------------------------------  
docker-compose -f ./docker-compose.yaml up  
# ✅ What it does: Reads the docker-compose.yaml file in the current directory and starts all defined services, showing logs in your terminal  
# 🧠 Why it matters: Enables easy and repeatable launching of multi-container setups without manual docker run commands  

# ------------------------------  
# ▶️ HOW TO RUN / EXECUTE THIS CODE IN WINDOWS POWERSHELL  
# ------------------------------  
# The same command works in PowerShell as in bash:  
docker-compose -f ./docker-compose.yaml up  

# ------------------------------  
# ✅ NOTES / GOTCHAS / TIPS  
# ------------------------------  
# - Add "-d" flag (docker-compose -f ./docker-compose.yaml up -d) to run containers in detached mode (background)  
# - Make sure Docker daemon is running before executing this command  
# - If you change the docker-compose.yaml file, restart with "docker-compose down" then "docker-compose up"  
# - Use "docker-compose logs" to view container logs after startup if needed
