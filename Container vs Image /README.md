#   2 - Container vs Image


# 📖 Summary

Worked on **Lab 2 - Container vs Image**, focusing on **containerizing PostgreSQL with Docker across multiple versions**.
Tasks included **setting up PostgreSQL containers (versions 13.10 and 14.7) with environment variable configuration and verifying running containers** to solve **the challenge of managing and testing multiple software versions in isolated environments**.
Used **Docker CLI commands to deploy and manage containers**, enabling seamless version compatibility and environment isolation.
