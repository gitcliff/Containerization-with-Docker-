# 📦 SUMMARY  
# This command displays all Docker containers that are currently running.  
# Language/Platform: Bash (Docker CLI)  
# What you'll learn: How to verify active Docker containers and see their metadata  
# Outcome: You get a table listing running containers (with IDs, images, ports, etc.)  
# Why this matters: Essential for monitoring, managing, or interacting with running containers (e.g., PostgreSQL)

# 🧩 SECTION TITLE: List Active Docker Containers  
# ------------------------------  
docker ps  
# ✅ What it does:  
# - Lists all containers that are actively running  
# - Displays details like:  
#   - CONTAINER ID (short ID of the container)  
#   - IMAGE (Docker image the container is running)  
#   - COMMAND (startup command for the container)  
#   - CREATED (how long ago it was started)  
#   - STATUS (e.g., Up 10 minutes)  
#   - PORTS (port mappings between host and container)  
#   - NAMES (automatically generated or user-defined container name)  

# 🧠 Why it matters:  
# - Lets you confirm your PostgreSQL container is running and listening on the right ports  
# - Needed before using commands like `docker exec`, `docker stop`, or `docker logs`  

# ------------------------------  
# ▶️ HOW TO RUN / EXECUTE THIS COMMAND  
# ------------------------------  
# Bash/Linux shell: Run as shown  
# PowerShell (Windows): Same command works directly in PowerShell or Command Prompt if Docker Desktop is installed  

# ------------------------------  
# ✅ NOTES / GOTCHAS / TIPS  
# ------------------------------  
# - To show **all containers** (including stopped ones):  
#   ```bash
#   docker ps -a
#   ```  
# - To get only container IDs (for scripting):  
#   ```bash
#   docker ps -q
#   ```  
# - If no containers are running, the output will be empty.
