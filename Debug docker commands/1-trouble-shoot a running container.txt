# 📦 SUMMARY  
# These commands check running containers, view logs of a specific container, and stop that container.  
# Language/Platform: Bash (Docker CLI)  
# What you'll learn: How to inspect container status, troubleshoot via logs, and gracefully stop containers  
# Outcome: Ability to manage container lifecycle and monitor container output for debugging or info  
# Why this matters: Managing container state and viewing logs is crucial for operating Dockerized applications effectively  

# ------------------------------  
# 🧩 SECTION TITLE: Inspect and Manage Docker Containers  
# ------------------------------  

docker ps  
# ✅ What it does: Lists all currently running Docker containers with their IDs, names, ports, and statuses  
# 🧠 Why it matters: Lets you identify the container(s) you want to inspect, monitor, or stop  

docker logs bc91edabf934  
# ✅ What it does: Shows logs from the container with ID `bc91edabf934` (can use partial ID if unique)  
# 🧠 Why it matters: Useful for debugging errors, monitoring app output, or verifying the container started correctly  

docker stop 0341642466b0 7ae27ea26c27  
# ✅ What it does: Stops two running containers identified by their IDs `0341642466b0` and `7ae27ea26c27`  
# 🧠 Why it matters: Gracefully shuts down services, freeing system resources without abruptly killing processes  

# ------------------------------  
# ▶️ HOW TO RUN / EXECUTE THESE COMMANDS  
# ------------------------------  
# Bash/Linux shell: Run as shown. Replace container IDs with actual IDs from `docker ps`.  
# PowerShell (Windows): Same commands work in PowerShell or Command Prompt with Docker Desktop installed.  

# ------------------------------  
# ✅ NOTES / GOTCHAS / TIPS  
# ------------------------------  
# - Container IDs can be partial (e.g., first 6–12 characters) if unique.  
# - Use `docker logs -f <container_id>` to follow logs live as they’re written. Press Ctrl+C to stop following.  
# - To restart a stopped container: `docker start <container_id>`  
# - Combine `docker ps -a` to view all containers, even those stopped, to get IDs for restarting or inspecting.
