# 📦 SUMMARY  
# These commands stop a running container by name, start a new Redis container named `redis-latest` mapped to port 6000, and list running containers.  
# Language/Platform: Bash (Docker CLI)  
# What you'll learn: How to stop containers by name, run containers with custom names and port mapping, and verify running containers  
# Outcome: Stops an old Redis container, runs a new Redis container on port 6000 with a friendly name, and confirms the running containers  
# Why this matters: Managing container lifecycle by name and using port mapping helps keep your Docker environment organized and accessible  

# ------------------------------  
# 🧩 SECTION TITLE: Stop and Start Redis Containers with Custom Names  
# ------------------------------  
docker stop amazing_chatterjee  
# ✅ What it does: Stops the running container named `amazing_chatterjee` gracefully  
# 🧠 Why it matters: Frees system resources and avoids port conflicts before starting a new container  

docker run -d -p 6000:6379 --name redis-latest redis  
# ✅ What it does:  
# - Runs the latest Redis container in detached mode  
# - Maps host port 6000 to container port 6379  
# - Names the container `redis-latest` for easier management  
# 🧠 Why it matters: You can access Redis on localhost:6000 and manage the container by name instead of ID  

docker ps  
# ✅ What it does: Lists all running containers including `redis-latest`  
# 🧠 Why it matters: Confirms your new Redis container is up and running with the expected configuration  

# ------------------------------  
# ▶️ HOW TO RUN / EXECUTE THESE COMMANDS  
# ------------------------------  
# Bash/Linux shell and PowerShell: Run commands exactly as shown. Replace container names if different.  

# ------------------------------  
# ✅ NOTES / GOTCHAS / TIPS  
# ------------------------------  
# - Always stop containers using their names or IDs before reusing ports.  
# - Use `docker logs redis-latest` to check the container output.  
# - To remove a container after stopping: `docker rm redis-latest`.
