#   Debug Commands


# 📖 Summary

Worked on **Lab 6 - Debug Commands**, focusing on **Docker container inspection, logging, and troubleshooting techniques**.
Tasks included **checking running containers, viewing logs, stopping problematic containers, running specific Redis versions, and interacting with container shells** to solve **issues related to container health and behavior in microservice environments**.
Set up **Docker CLI debugging commands** to inspect and manage container lifecycles, aiming to **improve reliability and reduce downtime in containerized applications**.
