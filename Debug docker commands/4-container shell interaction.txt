# 📦 SUMMARY  
# These commands open an interactive shell inside a running Docker container, navigate and explore its filesystem, and list environment variables.  
# Language/Platform: Bash (Docker CLI inside container)  
# What you'll learn: How to access a container’s terminal, explore files, and inspect environment variables within the container  
# Outcome: Interactive shell session inside the container with ability to inspect its environment and filesystem  
# Why this matters: Useful for debugging, configuration checks, and understanding container internals

# 🧩 SECTION TITLE: Access Container Shell and Inspect Environment  
# ------------------------------  
docker exec -it 32bca5f1d99e /bin/bash  
# ✅ What it does:  
# - Runs a Bash shell interactively inside the running container with ID `32bca5f1d99e`  
# - `-i` keeps STDIN open, `-t` allocates a terminal so you can interact  
# 🧠 Why it matters: Lets you run commands inside the container as if you were logged into it directly  

pwd  
# ✅ What it does: Prints the current directory inside the container  
# 🧠 Why it matters: Helps you know your location in the container’s filesystem  

cd /  
# ✅ What it does: Changes directory to the root directory `/` in the container  
# 🧠 Why it matters: Allows you to explore the root of the container filesystem  

ls  
# ✅ What it does: Lists files and folders in the current directory (`/`) inside the container  
# 🧠 Why it matters: Lets you see the contents of the root filesystem for inspection or navigation  

env  
# ✅ What it does: Displays all environment variables inside the container  
# 🧠 Why it matters: Useful for debugging configuration or verifying environment setup inside the container  

# ------------------------------  
# ▶️ HOW TO RUN / EXECUTE THIS COMMAND  
# ------------------------------  
# Bash/Linux shell and PowerShell: Run exactly as shown, replacing `32bca5f1d99e` with your container ID or name  

# ------------------------------  
# ✅ NOTES / GOTCHAS / TIPS  
# ------------------------------  
# - If `/bin/bash` doesn’t exist in your container, try `/bin/sh` instead.  
# - To exit the container shell, type `exit` or press Ctrl+D.  
# - Use this method to troubleshoot or modify running containers without restarting them.
