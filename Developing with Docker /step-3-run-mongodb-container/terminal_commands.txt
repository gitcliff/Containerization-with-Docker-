# 📦 SUMMARY  
# These commands start a MongoDB container on a custom Docker network with root credentials, expose the default port, check container logs, and list running containers.  
# Language/Platform: Bash (Docker CLI)  
# What you'll learn: How to run MongoDB with environment variables for authentication, connect it to a specific Docker network, and monitor container status  
# Outcome: A running MongoDB container named `mongodb` accessible on localhost:27017, with logs viewable for troubleshooting  
# Why this matters: Securely runs MongoDB in a container with authentication enabled and proper network isolation for multi-container apps  

# ------------------------------  
# 🧩 SECTION TITLE: Run MongoDB Container with Custom Network and Authentication  
# ------------------------------  
docker run --network mongo-network --name mongodb \
-e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=admin \
-e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=pass \
-p 27017:27017 \
-d mongo

# ✅ What it does:  
# - Runs MongoDB in detached mode (`-d`)  
# - Connects container to custom network `mongo-network` for secure communication  
# - Sets root username and password via environment variables for authentication  
# - Maps container port 27017 (default MongoDB port) to host port 27017 for external access  
# - Names the container `mongodb` for easy management  
# 🧠 Why it matters: Ensures MongoDB runs securely with user authentication, accessible from host machine, and isolated on a custom network  

docker logs <container_id>  
# ✅ What it does: Displays logs from the MongoDB container, where `<container_id>` is the container's ID or name (e.g., `mongodb`)  
# 🧠 Why it matters: Helps verify MongoDB started successfully and troubleshoot any startup issues  

docker ps  
# ✅ What it does: Lists all running containers, confirming the MongoDB container is active and showing container details  
# 🧠 Why it matters: Confirms that your MongoDB container is up and running, ready to accept connections  

# ------------------------------  
# ▶️ HOW TO RUN / EXECUTE THESE COMMANDS  
# ------------------------------  
# 1. Run the docker run command exactly as shown, replacing `<container_id>` with your container name or ID when checking logs.  
# 2. Use `docker ps` to check container status anytime.  

# ------------------------------  
# ✅ NOTES / GOTCHAS / TIPS  
# ------------------------------  
# - Replace `pass` and `admin` with secure credentials in production.  
# - Use container name `mongodb` in place of `<container_id>` for convenience:  
#   docker logs mongodb  
# - You can connect other containers on `mongo-network` directly to this MongoDB instance using `mongodb` as the hostname.
