#  Developing with Docker


# 📖 Summary

Worked on **- Developing with Docker**, focusing on **setting up a containerized development environment with MongoDB and Mongo Express using Docker networks**.
Tasks included **pulling official MongoDB and Mongo Express images, creating a Docker bridge network for secure inter-container communication, running MongoDB with authentication, launching Mongo Express as a web GUI, and connecting a Node.js app to MongoDB** to solve **challenges of simulating a production-like environment for secure database interactions and simplified management**.
Set up **Docker images and custom networks** to enable seamless container communication, aiming to **streamline full-stack development and testing in isolated, secure containerized environments**.

# 🛠️ Tools Used

* **Docker**: ✨ *Pulled images, created networks, ran containers with custom environment variables*
* **MongoDB**: ⚙️ *Provided the database service with authentication in a container*
* **Mongo Express**: 🚀 *Delivered a web-based GUI to manage and view MongoDB data*
* **Node.js**: 💻 *Ran a sample backend app to interact with the MongoDB container*

---

# 🎯 Skills Gained

* **Container Networking**: 💡 *Learned to create Docker networks for secure container-to-container communication*
* **Database Containerization**: 🔍 *Gained hands-on experience running a stateful database with environment-based authentication*
* **Full-Stack Containerized Development**: 🚀 *Connected backend Node.js app to Dockerized MongoDB for integrated testing and development*

---

# ⚠️ Challenges Faced

* **Ensuring Secure Container Communication**: 🛠️ *Overcame network isolation issues by creating and using a custom Docker bridge network*
* **Managing Environment Variables for Authentication**: 🔄 *Configured MongoDB and Mongo Express containers with matching credentials for seamless access*
