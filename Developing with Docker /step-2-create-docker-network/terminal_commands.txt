# 📦 SUMMARY  
# These commands list existing Docker networks, create a new custom network named `mongo-network`, and then list networks again to confirm creation.  
# Language/Platform: Bash (Docker CLI)  
# What you'll learn: How to manage Docker networks, create isolated environments for container communication, and verify network creation  
# Outcome: A dedicated Docker network `mongo-network` is created to allow containers like MongoDB and Mongo Express to communicate securely  
# Why this matters: Using custom Docker networks enables better security and network isolation for multi-container applications

# ------------------------------  
docker network ls  
# ✅ What it does: Lists all existing Docker networks on your system  
# 🧠 Why it matters: Helps you see current network configurations before adding new ones  

docker network create mongo-network  
# ✅ What it does: Creates a new Docker bridge network named `mongo-network`  
# 🧠 Why it matters: Custom networks allow containers to communicate by name and isolate traffic from other containers or networks  

docker network ls  
# ✅ What it does: Lists Docker networks again to confirm that `mongo-network` was successfully created  
# 🧠 Why it matters: Verifies your new network is available for use before running containers connected to it  

# ------------------------------  
# ▶️ HOW TO RUN / EXECUTE THESE COMMANDS  
# ------------------------------  
# Run commands one by one in bash or PowerShell. No special privileges required beyond Docker access.  

# ------------------------------  
# ✅ NOTES / GOTCHAS / TIPS  
# ------------------------------  
# - Custom networks help containers find each other by container name instead of IP.  
# - Use `docker network inspect mongo-network` to see detailed info about the created network.  
# - By default, `docker run` attaches containers to the `bridge` network if no network specified.
