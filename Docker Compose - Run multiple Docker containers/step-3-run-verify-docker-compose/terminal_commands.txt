# 📦 SUMMARY  
# This sequence brings up services from a Docker Compose file, then checks networks and running containers.  
# Language/Platform: Bash (Docker Compose & Docker CLI)  
# What you'll learn: Start multi-container apps, view Docker networks, and list active containers  
# Outcome: MongoDB and Mongo Express containers are running and accessible  
# Why this matters: Verifies your multi-container stack is properly deployed and networked  

# ------------------------------  
# 🧩 SECTION TITLE: Start Docker Compose Services and Verify Setup  
# ------------------------------  
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml up  
# ✅ What it does: Starts all services defined in `docker-compose.yaml` in the foreground  
# 🧠 Why it matters: Useful for debugging and seeing logs from all services together  
# 🔄 Alternative (detached mode):  
# docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml up -d  
# ✅ Detached mode runs containers in the background, freeing your terminal  

docker network ls  
# ✅ What it does: Lists all Docker networks currently available on your system  
# 🧠 Why it matters: Lets you confirm that Docker Compose created a custom network for service communication  
# 🔄 Typical output includes a network like `docker_default` or `mongo-network` from your YAML  

docker ps  
# ✅ What it does: Shows all currently running containers  
# 🧠 Why it matters: Helps verify that MongoDB and Mongo Express are up and running as expected  
# 🔄 Look for containers with names like `projectname_mongodb_1` and `projectname_mongo-express_1`  

# ------------------------------  
# ✅ NOTES / GOTCHAS / TIPS  
# ------------------------------  
# - If you see “port already in use” errors, check for existing containers:  
#   docker ps -a             # ✅ Lists all containers (running & stopped)  
# - To stop all Compose services:  
#   docker-compose down      # ✅ Stops containers and removes the network created by Compose  
# - For live logs after detached start:  
#   docker-compose logs -f   # ✅ Shows log output and follows updates
