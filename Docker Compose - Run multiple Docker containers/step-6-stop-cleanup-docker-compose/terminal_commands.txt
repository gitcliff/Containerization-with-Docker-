# 📦 SUMMARY  
# This sequence stops and removes all containers and networks created by the Docker Compose file, then lists existing networks and running containers.  
# Language/Platform: Bash (Docker Compose & Docker CLI)  
# What you'll learn: How to clean up your Docker Compose environment and verify Docker resources afterward  
# Outcome: All containers and networks from your Compose file are stopped and removed  
# Why this matters: Frees system resources and avoids port conflicts for future runs  

# ------------------------------  
# 🧩 SECTION TITLE: Stop and Remove Docker Compose Containers and Networks  
# ------------------------------  
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml down  
# ✅ What it does: Stops all containers defined in the Compose file and removes the containers, default network, and other resources created by Compose  
# 🧠 Why it matters: Cleans up your environment to prevent leftover containers or networks that may interfere with future runs  

docker network ls  
# ✅ What it does: Lists all Docker networks on your system after cleanup  
# 🧠 Why it matters: Confirms the Compose-created network has been removed, ensuring a clean slate  

docker ps  
# ✅ What it does: Lists all currently running containers (should be empty or only non-related containers)  
# 🧠 Why it matters: Verifies that the Compose containers have stopped and been removed  

# ------------------------------  
# ✅ NOTES / GOTCHAS / TIPS  
# ------------------------------  
# - To also remove volumes (e.g., MongoDB data), use:  
#   docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml down -v  
# - If you want to stop containers but keep volumes and network:  
#   docker-compose stop  
# - Use `docker ps -a` to see stopped containers that haven’t been removed
