# 📦 SUMMARY  
# This step installs Node.js dependencies and starts your JS app’s server.  
# Language/Platform: Node.js (npm, Express)  
# What you'll learn: Install project dependencies and run a Node server  
# Outcome: The app connects to MongoDB and serves HTTP requests  
# Why this matters: It verifies that your containerized MongoDB stack supports your app  

# ------------------------------  
# 🧩 SECTION TITLE: Install Dependencies and Start Server  
# ------------------------------  
npm install  
# ✅ What it does: Downloads and installs all dependencies listed in package.json (like Express, Mongoose, etc.)  
# 🧠 Why it matters: Ensures your project has all required Node.js libraries to run  

node server.js  
# ✅ What it does: Starts the Node.js server defined in server.js  
# 🧠 Why it matters: Boots up the application, which will now attempt to connect to MongoDB (via environment variables or config)  
# 🔄 If successful, the app should log:  
#    Listening on port <PORT_NUMBER>  

# ------------------------------  
# ▶️ HOW TO RUN / EXECUTE THIS CODE IN WINDOWS POWERSHELL  
# ------------------------------  
# Equivalent commands:  
npm install            # ✅ Same as in Linux, installs Node dependencies  
node .\server.js       # ✅ Runs server.js in the current folder  

# ------------------------------  
# ✅ NOTES / GOTCHAS / TIPS  
# ------------------------------  
# - If `node server.js` fails with “Cannot find module”:  
#   - Check `npm install` finished successfully  
# - To run in background (Linux):  
#   nohup node server.js &  
# - To use a process manager for production:  
#   npm install -g pm2  
#   pm2 start server.js
