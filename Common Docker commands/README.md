#  Main Docker Commands



# 📖 Summary

Worked on **Lab 5 - Main Docker Commands**, focusing on **Docker CLI for container management and port binding**.
Tasks included **pulling Docker images, running containers in foreground and detached modes, stopping/restarting containers, and exposing container ports to the host system** to solve **challenges of managing container lifecycles and enabling external access to containerized services**.
Set up **Docker on a local system** to automate and optimize container management, aiming to **build confidence in controlling containerized applications—a key skill in DevOps pipelines**.

# 🛠️ Tools Used

* **Docker**: ✨ *Used to pull images, run and manage containers, and bind ports for external access*
* **Docker Hub**: ⚙️ *Pulled Redis images directly from the repository to run specific versions*
* **CLI (Command Line Interface)**: 🚀 *Executed all Docker commands to manage container lifecycles efficiently*

---

# 🎯 Skills Gained

* **Container Lifecycle Management**: 💡 *Learned to create, stop, restart, and list containers using Docker CLI*
* **Port Binding and Networking**: 🔍 *Understood how to expose container services externally by mapping ports*
* **Image Version Control**: 🚀 *Developed the ability to pull and run specific image versions (e.g., Redis 6.2)*

---

# ⚠️ Challenges Faced

* **Managing Detached Containers**: 🛠️ *Overcame confusion about background containers by using `docker ps -a` and managing with `docker start/stop`*
* **Port Conflicts**: 🔄 *Resolved port binding issues by assigning unique host ports for each container (e.g., 6000:6379, 6001:6379)*

# 💡 Why It Matters

This lab strengthens expertise in **containerization fundamentals**, demonstrating how tools like **Docker** improve software delivery through lightweight, portable environments.
Mastering these core Docker commands lays the groundwork for more advanced DevOps practices, such as orchestration with Kubernetes and automated CI/CD pipelines. 🚀🌐
